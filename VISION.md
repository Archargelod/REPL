# Vision

Theoretically, REPL can run any programming language in existence because it requires that you already have the necessary runtimes/compilers installed on your machine. This is the goal. REPL should be a tool useful to anyone and everyone who wants to prototype or test out code snippets **extremely** fast, regardless of the programming language.

REPL is not a project manager. Using REPL should be simple and straight to the point. Note that this does not mean it shouldn't be highly configurable. On the contrary, REPL **should** be highly configurable to suit any environment (including Windows environments).

REPL is offline-first. An internet connection should never be required to use it. Support for opening new repls, in the browser, at repl.it is a nice-to-have, but should never be forced on users.

### Why REPL?

REPL really shines if you work with a compiled language. Some programming languages don't have a native repl-like environment like `irb` for Ruby and `node.js` for JavaScript. Even then, using REPL provides you with a single interface that is easy to use, and you never have to worry about file management with REPL.

REPL has already become a staple in my own development environments. I use it almost daily now. I hope REPL can do as much for you as it does for me.
